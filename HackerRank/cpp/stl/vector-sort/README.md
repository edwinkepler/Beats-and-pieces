# Vector-Sort

You are given `N` integers. Sort the `N` integers and print the sorted order.
Store the `N` integers in a vector.Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

Declaration:

```
vector<int>v; (creates an empty vector of integers)
```

Size:

```
int size=v.size();
```

Pushing an integer into a vector:

```
v.push_back(x);(where x is an integer.The size increases by 1 after this.)
```

Popping the last element from the vector:

```
v.pop_back(); (After this the size decreases by 1)
```

Sorting a vector:

```
sort(v.begin(),v.end()); (Will sort all the elements in the vector)
```
