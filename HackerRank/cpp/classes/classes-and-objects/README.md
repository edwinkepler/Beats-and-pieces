# Classes and objects

A class defines a blueprint for an object. We use the same syntax to declare objects of a class as we use to declare variables of other basic types. For example:

```
Box box1;          // Declares variable box1 of type Box
Box box2;          // Declare variable box2 of type Box
```

Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the `5` exams given during this semester.

Create a class named `Student` with the following specifications:

 - An instance variable named `Scores` to hold a student's `5` exam scores.
 - A void *input()* function that reads `5` integers and saves them to `scores`.
 - An int *calculateTotalScore()* function that returns the sum of the student's scores.
