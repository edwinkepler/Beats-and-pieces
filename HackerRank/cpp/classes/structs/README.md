# Structs

*struct* is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure, which further lays the foundation for Object Oriented Programming. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his *age (int)*, *first_name (string)*, *last_name (string)* and *standard (int)*. 

*struct* can be represented as

```
struct NewType {
    type1 value1;
    type2 value2;
    .
    .
    .
    typeN valueN;
};
```

You have to create a struct, named `Student`, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.
