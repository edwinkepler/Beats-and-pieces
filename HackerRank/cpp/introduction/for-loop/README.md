# For Loop

A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax for this is

```
for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
```

*expression_1* is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling terminating flag for the loop.

*expression_2* is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.

*expression_3* is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop will be

```
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
```
