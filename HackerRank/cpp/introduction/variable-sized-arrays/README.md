# Variable Sized Arrays

Consider an `n`-element array, `a`, where each index `i` in the array contains a reference to an array of `ki` integers (where the value of `ki` varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given `a`, you must answer `q` queries. Each query is in the format i j, where `i` denotes an index in array `a` and `j` denotes an index in the array located at `a[i]`. For each query, find and print the value of element `j` in the array at location `a[i]` on a new line.
