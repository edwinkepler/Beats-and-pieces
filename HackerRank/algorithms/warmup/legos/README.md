# LEGOs

Sarah has four different kinds of LEGO pieces of different counts. She gives two types of LEGO to her friend and keeps the other two. She is putting two pieces together by picking one from each of the two types that she has left.

More specifically, the counts for each of the LEGO pieces are `a`, `b` and `c`, respectively. The two types that Sarah gave her friend had `p` and `q` pieces, while the types that she kept have `r` and `s` pieces, respectively. Find `r x s` which would represent the number of two-piece LEGO combinations that Sarah can make.

Note that only `a, b, c, d, p` and `q` will be given as input.
