# Breaking the record

Maria plays `n` games of college basketball in a season. Because she wants to go pro, she tracks her points scored per game sequentially in an array defined as `score = [s0, s1,...,s(n-1)]`. After each game `i`, she checks to see if score `s(i)` breaks her record for most or least points scored so far during that season.

Given Maria's array of `scores` for a season of `n` games, find and print the number of times she breaks her record for most and least points scored during the season.

**Note:** Assume her records for most and least points at the start of the season are the number of points scored during the first game of the season.
