# Sock merchant

John's clothing store has a pile of `n` loose socks where each sock `i` is labeled with an integer, `c(i)`, denoting its color. He wants to sell as many socks as possible, but his customers will only buy them in matching pairs. Two socks, `i` and `j`, are a single matching pair if they have the same color `(c(i) == c(j))`.

Given `n` and the color of each sock, how many pairs of socks can John sell?
