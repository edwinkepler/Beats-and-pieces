# Cats and mouse

Two cats named `A` and `B` are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat `A` is standing at point `x` and cat `B` is standing at point `y`. Both cats run at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named `C` that's hiding at integral point `z` on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given `q` queries in the form of `x`, `y`, and `z`. For each query, print the appropriate answer on a new line:

- If cat `A` catches the mouse first, print `Cat A`.

- If cat  catches the mouse first, print ``Cat B`.

- If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print `Mouse C` as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.
