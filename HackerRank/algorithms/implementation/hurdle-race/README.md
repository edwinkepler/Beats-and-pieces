# Hurdle race

Dan is playing a video game in which his character competes in a hurdle race by jumping over `n` hurdles with heights `h0, h1,...,hn-1`. He can initially jump a maximum height of `k` units, but he has an unlimited supply of magic beverages that help him jump higher! Each time Dan drinks a magic beverage, the maximum height he can jump during the race increases by `1` unit.

Given `n`, `k`, and the heights of all the hurdles, find and print the *minimum* number of magic beverages Dan must drink to complete the race.
