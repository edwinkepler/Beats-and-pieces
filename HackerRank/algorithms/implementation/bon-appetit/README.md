# Bon appetit

Anna and Brian order `n` items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of the `k(th)` item (where `0 < k < n`) due to an allergy. When the check comes, they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared; however, Brian may have forgotten that they didn't split the `k(th)` item and accidentally charged Anna for it.

You are given `n`, `k`, the cost of each of the `n` items, and the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her portion of the bill. If the bill is fairly split, print `Bon Appetit`; otherwise, print the amount of money that Brian must refund to Anna.
