# Drawing book

Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their `n`-page book to page number `p`. Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number `1`) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number `n`), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page `1` is always on the right side:

![example](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/0/1481920803-d2b54f38f0-book.png "Example")

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given `n` and `p`, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page `p`.
