# Beautiful Days at the Movies

Lily likes to play games with integers and their *reversals*. For some integer `x`, we define `reversed(x)` to be the reversal of all digits in `x`. For example, `reversed(123) = 321`.

Logan wants to go to the movies with Lily on some day `x`  satisfying `i <= x <= j`, but he knows she only goes to the movies on days she considers to be beautiful. Lily considers a day to be beautiful if the absolute value of the difference between `x` and `reversed(x)` is evenly divisible by `k`.

Given `i`, `j`, and `k`, count and print the number of *beautiful* days when Logan and Lily can go to the movies.
