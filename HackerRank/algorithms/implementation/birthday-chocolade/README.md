# Birthday chocolade

Lily has a chocolate bar consisting of a row of `n` squares where each square has an integer written on it. She wants to share it with Ron for his birthday, which falls on month `m` and day `d`. Lily wants to give Ron a piece of chocolate only if it contains `m` consecutive squares whose integers sum to `d`.

Given `m`, `d`, and the sequence of integers written on each square of Lily's chocolate bar, how many different ways can Lily break off a piece of chocolate to give to Ron?

For example, if `m = 2`, `d = 3` and the chocolate bar contains `n` rows of squares with the integers `[1,2,1,3,2]` written on them from left to right, the following diagram shows two ways to break off a piece:
