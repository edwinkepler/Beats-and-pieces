Colleen is turning `n` years old! Therefore, she has `n` candles of various heights on her cake, and candle `i` has height `height(i)`. Because the taller candles tower over the shorter ones, Colleen can only blow out the tallest candles.

Given the `height(i)` for each individual candle, find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.
