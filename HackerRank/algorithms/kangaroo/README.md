# Kangaroo

There are two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location `x1` and moves at a rate of `v1` meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location `x2` and moves at a rate of `v2` meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if they'll ever land at the same location at the same time?
